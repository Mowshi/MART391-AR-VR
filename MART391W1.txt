Augmented Reality (AR) has been a curious phenomenon for a couple decades now, making it a familiar concept, but still new enough for the technology to still be in its developmental stages. In recent years, AR has taken the spotlight in mobile games such as Pokemon Go and Minecraft Earth. These games do a fantastic job of introducing the general public to the technology by making fun interactive games, but AR has far more potential than just phone games. During the late ‘90s and early 2000s, AR was introduced to the Airforce and NASA for use in navigation systems in aircraft and spacecraft. To this day, that technology is still being used and evolved by those government programs. AR is also being talked about in the medical field now more than ever. The idea of doctors and other medical professionals being aided by computers to view information more intuitively has been in conversation for a few years and would be a massive leap forward in the industry.
